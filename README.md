<h2>NOTE: I use AHK v1 on my System. It's very likely that this breaks on v2.</h2>

Contains Utilities for AutoHotkey, used in Horizon Forbidden West, because the game has horrendously broken controls. This aims to fix some of those, until the Devs fix those.

Contains:
- Weapon-Wheel on Tab (works on sprint, alt+tab/alt+shift+tab works)
- Spear Light & Heavy-Attacks like in Zero Dawn (LMouse for light, Shift+LMouse for Heavy)
