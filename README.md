<h2>NOTE: I use AHK v1 on my System. It's very likely that this breaks on v2.</h2>

Contains Utilities for AutoHotkey, used in Horizon Forbidden West, because the game has horrendously broken controls. This aims to fix some of those, until the Devs fix those.

Contains:
- Weapon-Wheel on "Tab" (works on sprint, alt+tab/alt+shift+tab works)
- ~~Spear Light & Heavy-Attacks like in Zero Dawn (LMouse for light, Shift+LMouse for Heavy)~~ Removed, as it was quite buggy.
- "Tab+Middle-Mouse-Button" to "V", defaults to "holster weapon"

NOTE: As of Path 1.1.47.0, The game now supports rebinding tab Natively. Tho it is still not possible to use any modifier key with tab, which makes tab still unusable when using for ex. hold-to-sprint, or while dodging with ctrl.
This script still retains this functionality.
